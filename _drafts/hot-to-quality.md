## You build it, you test it

## You build it, we test it

So, _you build it — you test it_ approach is very easy, but also very unreliable. 

To make this happen, we need one extra thing — a shared understanding of the . Another thing that's immensely helpful 

Overall, adding extra people to the testing process brings amazing benefits well worth the extra effort:

3. Lower chance of totally forgetting any testing for a feature.
1. More team members are aware of the feature we're building — great
2. A more coherent view of the business requirements
2. A fresh mind can spot missed test cases, side-effects and preconditions

On the flip side, extra manual testing takes up more of the team time, and doesn't scale well. Ideally, you don't only check the new feature, but also verify the existing functionality is not affected by the change (called regression testing). As the product grows, you need to check more and more stuff, and eventually this becomes a limiting factor for delivering changes.

## It tests itself

Enter automated testing. 

## Testing in production

As much as I love automated testing, 

## Customer support
