I like reading blogs so much I subscribed to a hundred. I would really like to read on programming or theoretical computer science. Can I, please? Nope, tech people do not waste time writing.

Designers are a different bunch. Every day I get all kinds of posts from all kinds of designers. My feed gushes with hilarious observations, rants on these days' UX, critiques and sketches.

The "coding" tag in my feed conveniently groups 41 guy, not counting collective blogs: [graph theoreticians](http://markorodriguez.com/category/blog/graph-theory/), a bunch of [back-end developers](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com) and a security specialist and so on. Last month these brilliant people have managed to produce a whopping 49 posts. Of these, 34 come form corporate blogs and feel somewhat forced, another 4 are of "Released X version Y with improved encryption" kind &mdash; what an exciting read!

Most of the interesting tech posts I come across come from dead blogs. My "coding" feed section is a graveyard. A wonderful blog of 3 posts, latest written 1071 days, what a pity. The freshest post from  my "data science" section (I optimized prematurely) is 49 days old. [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) has fossilized his blog into a couple of fun books and settled at one post a year.

Something is wrong.
