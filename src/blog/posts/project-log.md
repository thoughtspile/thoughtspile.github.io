## Mission intent:

- recreate a GMG website as seen in some top bootstrapped websites list
- learn some bootstrap along the way
- maybe use sass

## Mission log:

- think "OK, I'm gonna stick with the plain old CSS"
- get excited with SASS; try to use all the features at once
- feel bad about 4 very similar blocks in HTML
- enjoy the awesomeness of ::before (see quote decorations)
- google HTML preprocessors, come up with Jade (too fancy for now)
- settle with mustache client template
- be happy for 15 minutes
- feel bad about wrapping divs in divs
- spend a day fucking with absolute :: before postioning to recreate full width background
- get desperate to the point of posting a question to SO (my last one got heavily downvoted; that was fair enough, I'm still ashamed of tagging a Three.js question with jQuery just because all js-related questions seemed to have that tag)
- find out that bootstrap styles ::before with display: table; and get angry with bootstrap
- move on
- if everyone is so smart, why is so much code so shitty?

## Byproducts

- learnt a bit of mustache here
- and some sass there
- made a blog
