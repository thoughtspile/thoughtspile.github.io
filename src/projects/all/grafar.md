This javascript library brings real-time 3D visualization to the web. Built for performance and interactivity using reactive programming. The project is so awesome it got me a bachelor's degree in computer science.

I've spent over two years working on this project, and still consider it a work in progress. At least I have plenty of materials to showcase for it. Most of these are in Russian, but you might get some idea of what it's capable of and peek through the pictures:

- An early [demo presentation](http://thoughtspile.github.io/presentation-hub/grafar_for_lomonosov.html) made for a little talk.
- A [presentation](http://thoughtspile.github.io/presentation-hub/grafar_thesis_demo.html) for my thesis.
- I also have a couple of papers, but who wants to read obscure academic texts anyways.
- Here's the latest github [branch](https://github.com/thoughtspile/Grafar/tree/dev2). Master is terribly outdated, and I blame myself for it constantly, but that's how it is.

I'd occasionally post something grafar-related on my [blog]({{{site.url}}}/blog), hold on to your hats! Crazy tips on javascript performance tuning and computational topology are crawling in my head.
