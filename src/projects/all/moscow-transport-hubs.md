title: Moscow transport hubs
type: project
---
An interactive d3 <a href='http://thoughtspile.github.io/transport-vis/vis.html' target='_blank'>visualization</a> exploring the transport hubs in Moscow. I have not yet decided where I want to go with it, the first couple of ideas turned out not to be particularly exciting.

Currently I'm stuck with my will to make the most beautiful hub mark imaginable,, which dragged me into the wonderful world of metaballs, Voronoi decompositions and alpha-complexes. Peek at the <a href='http://thoughtspile.github.io/transport-vis/complex-hull.html' target='_blank'>frontier</a>, if you're interested. It's a tad over my head now, so I'm gone to work on something else.
