title: Trig parser
type: project
---
A project for computer algebra class. Apart from being a duct tape development masterpiece, it features nice bits of d3, context-free grammars and web design.

Visit the project [page](http://thoughtspile.github.io/Computer-Algebra-Project). It is not completely functional since the homegrown web services I was using have gone down since then, but the parsing, constant folding and an exemplary symbolic optimization still work. This page is also a prime candidate for redesign: when originally designing it, I've made a heroic effort of emulating CSS media queries without actually using them, as I was not aware of their existence.
