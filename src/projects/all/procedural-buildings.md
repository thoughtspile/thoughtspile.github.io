title: Procedural towns
type: project
---
Another project showing my passion for procedural content generation. This [little app](http://thoughtspile.github.io/Shape-grammars/canvas-test.html) generates cute European towns using Müller, Wonka et al's take on shape grammars (full article, [Procedural Modelling of Buildings](http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf), is available for free at Peter Wonka's website).

When I return to this project, I would probably first extend it with multiple layers and add some interactivity (why use js if you only get a static picture?). Wonka and Müller have also written a neat article called [Interactive Procedural Street Modelling](http://www.peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2008.SG.Chen.InteractiveProceduralStreetModeling.pdf), which would be the final piece in my meta-quest for city generation. If you have any interest whatsoever in procedural modelling, be sure to start with these guys' bibliography, the only thing they lack is naming creativity.

If you've missed out on my [procedural terrain generator](../terrain-generation), be sure to check it out, too.
