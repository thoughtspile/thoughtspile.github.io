I always thought I understood semver, but that illusion disappeared once I started maintaining libraries myself. Semver has tricky edge cases where it's unclear what the new version number should be:</p><ul><li>Should you bump anything after a refactoring? Can you have a refactor-only release at all?</li><li>What's the new version after updating a dependency? (spoiler: it <em>depends</em>)</li><li>Is dropping IE11 support a minor or major?</li><li>Is fixing a bug always a patch-level change? (Spoiler: no)</li><li>Does rewording &quot;support multi-line content in button&quot; to &quot;fix multi-line button&quot; turn a minor into a patch?</li><li>What if a bug can't be fixed without a breaking change?</li></ul><p>In this post, I'll explore these problems in depth, and share my tips on handling them.</p><p><img src="/images/semver.jpg" alt=""></p><h2>A quick intro to SemVer</h2><p>A Semanic Version, or semver, has a format of <code>major.minor.patch-(maybe) prerelease</code> — three numbers and some gibberish after a dash that we'll ignore for today. As <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the semver spec</a> explains it:</p><ul><li>MAJOR makes incompatible API changes,</li><li>MINOR adds functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and</li><li>PATCH makes backwards compatible bug fixes.</li></ul><p>The trick is, SemVer talks about the public API of your package, and the concept of <em>API</em> is a bit fuzzy, so it's not really as strict as you'd expect.</p><p>In product front-end development, life is simple. Your product has no public API, no other code depends on it, so you don't really care. Three-number semver format is still useful, since many node tools support it, but you can do whatever you like with the numbers. Using a single number, incrementing it on every build, is just fine: <code>0.0.123 -&gt; 0.0.124</code>, why not. Classic git flow works well with two numbers: minor for releases, patch for hotfixes: <code>1.1.0 -&gt; 1.2.0</code>, then <code>1.2.1</code> if you fix a bug. You can also increment the major version to congratulate yourself on a particularly big feature: <code>1.2.0 -&gt; 2.0.0</code> = <em>well done, Vladimir.</em> Really, anything works.</p><p>Once your code becomes a library (and I expect this to happen more often as micro-frontends grow), you need a way to communicate the API compatibility of your new releases to consumers. You need real semver, and you have two conflicting goals. First, you must follow the <em>semantic</em> part of semver to tell the consumers if they can safely update. This also helps package managers decide if a particular version can be reused between several consumers, or must be duplicated. <em>But</em> you also want to increment the version as slowly as possible — frequent breaking changes and even large minor increments are scary for your consumers, and may lead to duplicate versions of your library in the final app.</p><h2>SemVer no-ops</h2><p>Sometimes you haven't really done anything visible from the outside, but still want to release. Refactorings, performance improvements, documentation changes fall in this category. In all these cases, I usually go with a patch update, because:</p><ul><li>Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version — <a href="https://semver.org/#spec-item-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semver spec says so.</a></li><li>It's hard to re-release a version with the same number anyways.</li><li>It provides a way to identify the version if you created some new bugs.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://semver.org/#spec-item-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spec p. 7</a> allows you to bump minor for <em>&quot;substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code&quot;</em> but come figure what <em>substantial</em> means. Anyways, see an <a href="https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official discussion</a>.</p><h2>Changelog</h2><p>SemVer is useless without a changelog: have a breaking change? Amazing, but what is it and what should your users do about it? Good places to maintain the changelog are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub releases,</a>, <code>CHANGELOG.md</code>, confluence / dropbox paper / whatever for internal projects, a dedicated page in the docs, or even a pinned message in the support chat. Just make sure all your users know where to look for it.</p><h2>Releases with multiple changes</h2><p>This one is clear, but keep an eye out: if you release changes in batches, the new version must be the largest of versions from each change. Some examples of a release after <code>1.2.3</code>:</p><ul><li>3 bug fixes = patch, <code>1.2.4</code></li><li>3 bug fixes + 1 feature = minor, <code>1.3.0</code></li><li>3 bug fixes + 1 breaking change = major, <code>2.0.0</code></li><li>1 feature + 1 breaking change = major, <code>2.0.0</code></li></ul><p>If you have a patch release planned, but add a feature to it, don't forget to change it to a minor release, etc.</p><h2>Breaking bug fixes</h2><p>Say you release a buggy <code>1.2.3</code> — a dropdown component calls <code>onClose</code> on open. Strictly speaking, if you now stop calling <code>onClose</code> on open, you must release <code>2.0.0</code>, because it's a breaking change — your fix breaks apps that rely on <code>onClose</code> firing on open. On the other hand, a major release is likely to confuse everyone and scare them away from updating, so you should prefer <code>1.2.4</code>. There's no hard rule for situations like this, use your best judgement to decide if you can get away releasing the patch. Some things to consider:</p><ul><li>Can you know for sure if anyone actually relies on the broken behavior? Maybe search the codebase for internal projects, or ask around.</li><li>Does the broken behavior make no sense or contradict the documentation?</li><li>Has the bug been there for a long time? If you've been calling <code>onClose</code> on open for 2 years, since <code>0.0.1</code>, some users may well rely on it, especially if you didn't have an <code>onOpen</code>. If you just released it 5 minutes ago, just patch and deprecate the broken version ASAP.</li><li>Can you support <em>both</em> the broken and the fixed versions? This is often the case for typos, like <code>onColse -&gt; onClose</code>. If you can — go with it, <a href="/2021/09/22/dev-warnings/">warn</a> on the old name and don't forget to remove it in the next major release.</li></ul><p>If you do release the breaking bufix as a patch, consider deprecating the broken version <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/deprecating-and-undeprecating-packages-or-package-versions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via npm,</a> mentioning it in the changelog and notifying your users in the support chat / twitter.</p><h2>Feature-like bug fixes</h2><p><em>Bug fix</em> in semver terms is loosely related to normal person's idea of bug vs feature. Sometimes you can't fix a bug in the current API. In this case, <em>fixing</em> it is a <em>feature,</em> so you must release a <em>minor.</em></p><p>For example, your button component looks bad when you pass multi-line content. If you edit some CSS or adjust the display based on <code>offsetHeight</code>, it's a patch. If you add a special <code>multiline</code> option that users should pass for multiline content, you've just implemented a feature — <em>support multi-line content in buttons,</em> so a <em>minor.</em></p><h2>Feature vs Enhancement</h2><p>The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27572557/scrum-terminology-what-is-the-difference-between-a-new-feature-and-an-enhanceme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature / enhancement distinction</a> happens to be much more practical in SemVer. Say, you improve the positioning of a dropdown so that it detects scroll overflow and automatically chooses the up / down direction. Is it a bug fix, because the old behavior was <em>incorrect,</em> or a feature, because now your library does something it didn't do before?</p><p>I usually go for a feature (<em>minor</em> increment) in these cases, because a <em>patch</em> seems confusing, and a <em>major</em> is scary, but you can choose a different path. Some PRs to semver spec (<a href="https://github.com/semver/semver/pull/415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#415</a> or <a href="https://github.com/semver/semver/pull/588" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#588</a>) allow you to make such changes in a patch, since it does not affect the API.</p><h2>Type updates</h2><p>Obviously, if your library has a TypeScript / Flow / whatever interface, any change to the interface type should be reflected in the version number. A type-only change, like exporting an interface that was internal, is a feature that deserves a minor bump.</p><h2>Dependency updates</h2><p>What should the new version of your package be if you update a package B you depend on? Summary of the <a href="https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/148" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official discussion:</a></p><ul><li>If your library completely wraps the dependency and your users can't interact with package B, ignore it and version as per <em>your</em> change.</li><li>If your library exposes the underlying package B by letting the users access its objects or passing through user options, find out if the minor / breaking changes in B affects the <em>exact part</em> you expose. A safe &amp; lazy option is to match your major / minor / patch update to the update in B.</li><li>Updating a <em>peer</em> dependency (like <code>React</code>), requires the users of your lib to also update that dependency, so it's breaking.</li><li>Updating a <em>dev</em> dependency is usually a no-op. Caveat: <em>if</em> you update TypeScript <em>and</em> use some new features in your public types, it's essentially a <em>peer</em> dep update, so breaking.</li></ul><p>I often see libraries update deps in a minor. I'd rather not do that, but I'm not completely against it, as long as the update path for package B is safe. Updating peer major in a minor release is pure evil, though.</p><h2>Compatibility changes</h2><p>Most libraries increase the major version when dropping runtime support. If your library runs in IE11, but then you add an unpolyfilled <code>.closest</code>, it's a breaking change because it may <em>break</em> some apps that were supposed to run in IE11. <em>Increasing</em> runtime compatibility (like adding a polyfill) is a no-op. The key here is the public compatibility guarantees you give — if you say &quot;runs in IE11&quot; in your docs, it's your API now, and dropping it is breaking. If you never promised IE11, you can argue that it just <em>happens</em> to work as an implementation detail and ignore it in your versioning.</p><hr><p>Here are my 10 semver lessons from 2 years of open-source work:</p><ol><li>Internal changes, like optimizations and refactorings, get either a <em>patch</em> bump or a <em>minor</em> bump if they're <em>substantial,</em> whatever that means.</li><li>Semver is useless without a good changelog detailing the chagnes.</li><li>Bump the highest component in releases with multiple changes: <em>bug fix + feature = minor.</em></li><li>A breaking change in a patch may be OK if it fixes a bug, and users are unlikely to depend on the broken behavior.</li><li><em>Features</em> don't change the API can fit into a <em>patch.</em></li><li>If a <em>bug fix</em> touches the API, it's a <em>feature,</em> so it gets a <em>minor</em> bump.</li><li>Your public types affect semver, too.</li><li>Updating dependencies affects your version as much as you expose their API.</li><li>Updating peer dependencies is <em>breaking.</em></li><li>Dropping browser / runtime compatibility is <em>breaking.</em></li></ol></div><span class="share"><div><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://thoughtspile.github.io/2021/11/08/semver-challenges/&text=SemVer: The Tricky Parts by @thoughtspile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweet</a></div><div id="share-button"><a>Share</a></div></span><div class="social-links"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vklepov/" class="link--bare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="linkedin" class="svg-inline--fa fa-linkedin fa-w-14" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M416 32H31.9C14.3 32 0 46.5 0 64.3v383.4C0 465.5 14.3 480 31.9 480H416c17.6 0 32-14.5 32-32.3V64.3c0-17.8-14.4-32.3-32-32.3zM135.4 416H69V202.2h66.5V416zm-33.2-243c-21.3 0-38.5-17.3-38.5-38.5S80.9 96 102.2 96c21.2 0 38.5 17.3 38.5 38.5 0 21.3-17.2 38.5-38.5 38.5zm282.1 243h-66.4V312c0-24.8-.5-56.7-34.5-56.7-34.6 0-39.9 27-39.9 54.9V416h-66.4V202.2h63.7v29.2h.9c8.9-16.8 30.6-34.5 62.9-34.5 67.2 0 79.7 44.3 79.7 101.9V416z"></path></svg></a><a href="https://github.com/thoughtspile" class="link--bare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="github" class="svg-inline--fa fa-github fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 496 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6 0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6 0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3 0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1 0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4 0 0-70 15-84.7-29.8 0 0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6 0 0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4 0 0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5 0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9 0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4 0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6 0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6 0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9 0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"></path></svg></a><a href="/atom.xml" class="link--bare" target="_blank"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="rss" class="svg-inline--fa fa-rss fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M0 64C0 46.3 14.3 32 32 32c229.8 0 416 186.2 416 416c0 17.7-14.3 32-32 32s-32-14.3-32-32C384 253.6 226.4 96 32 96C14.3 96 0 81.7 0 64zM128 416c0 35.3-28.7 64-64 64s-64-28.7-64-64s28.7-64 64-64s64 28.7 64 64zM32 160c159.1 0 288 128.9 288 288c0 17.7-14.3 32-32 32s-32-14.3-32-32c0-123.7-100.3-224-224-224c-17.7 0-32-14.3-32-32s14.3-32 32-32z"></path></svg></a></div><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/thoughtspile" class="link--bare bmc-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><b>Hello, friend!</b> My name is Vladimir, and I love writing about web development.
