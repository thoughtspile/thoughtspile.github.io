Amazing! Bad news first: writing code is only the beginning. The information for library authors on the web is surprisingly fragmented, so I've decided to put together a list of things to keep in mind when open-sourcing a JS library:</p><ul><li>Decent docs, an OSS license, TypeScript definitions and a changelog are a must if you want anyone to use your library.</li><li>Build setup of a library is different from that of an app — but even simpler, if you know what to do.</li><li><code>peerDependenies</code> are a thing (also, npm / yarn version resolution is a nightmare).</li></ul><p>I'll give you enough info on each point to get started without going too deep.</p><p>I assume you're comfortable with <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">babel</a> and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webpack</a> (or any other build toolchain), and have followed some <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/workflow-publishing-first-package-to-npm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic tutorial</a> on publishing an npm package. I also suggest you host your code on GitHub — it has a ton of features useful for OSS, and any other choice is just <em>bizarre</em> in 2021. Let's pick up where you've written some code, pushed it to a public github repo, set up your <code>package.json</code> with <code>name</code>, <code>version</code> and <code>main</code>, and got <code>npm publish</code> to pass. There's still a bumpy ride ahead.</p><p><img src="/images/oss-scream.jpg" alt=""></p><h2>Documentation</h2><p>Your library will be used by people who have no idea what it's supposed to do, and how it works. For a small project, don't block yourself into building a fancy docs website — a <code>readme.md</code> file in the repo root is enough. Writing the actual docs is a better way to spend your time. Make sure to include:</p><ul><li>What problem does your project solve? Does your library do something I need?</li><li>How to install it? Even if it's <code>npm i my-project</code>, don't make me guess the package name.</li><li>A basic usage example. Just something to copy-paste and get started with it.</li><li>Full API docs. What can the library do? Does it cover all my use-cases? What arguments do I pass where? I shouldn't have to read the source to answer these questions.</li></ul><p>See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">markdown cheatsheet</a> if you're not fluent yet.</p><h2>License</h2><p><em>(I'm not a lawyer, but this is my understanding).</em> A project without an explicit license is closed source by default — the users can look at the code, but can't legally use it. <a href="https://choosealicense.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose an open-source license,</a> copy the text into a <code>LICENSE</code> file to your repo, put the name in the <code>license</code> field of <code>package.json</code>, and probably mention it in the readme. <a href="https://mit-license.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT license</a> is a good choice if you just want everyone to use your code and don't have a strong opinion on <em>everything must be open-source.</em></p><h2>Package structure</h2><p>When building an app, you have some transpiler + bundler (probably babel + webpack, but anything goes) setup to turn your source into someting that runs in a browser. If you don't want to make your users jump around patching webpack config, you need <em>some</em> of that, too. Exactly <em>how</em> you should package your code is a complex topic, but let me scratch the surface for you. TLDR:</p><ul><li>If you use extended JS (JSX / TS / whatever), or want to support older runtimes with zero setup, do a <code>babel</code> (or friends) pass.</li><li>Have a ES-module build for tree-shaking, and a legacy CommonJS build.</li><li>Be clear about supported browsers / node versions. Too much = bloat, too little = broken apps for users who don't do extra setup (they won't).</li><li>Never use global polyfills, and prefer well-supported APIs when possible.</li><li>Don't bother bundling.</li></ul><p>Just a touch deeper:</p><h3>Transpiling</h3><p>The code you ship <em>must</em> be standard ES to &quot;just work&quot; for your users. Convert JSX / TypeScript / Vue SFC / other fancy syntax down to JS with <code>babel</code>, <code>tsc</code>, or whatever <code>esbuild</code> you enjoy, and point <code>main</code> to the built version instead of your raw source.</p><p>The exact ES target (ES2020 / 6 / 5) is up to you — pick a browser / node target and stick to it. Your users <em>can</em> transpile further down, if they're determined, but undoing an unnecessary transform is next to impossible — it becomes bloat in the final app. Also, some babel transforms (like <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-unicode-regex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unicode regex</a>) are <em>very</em> verbose — have a look at the generated code once in a while.</p><p>The most important question is what to do with <code>import / export</code>. Read on.</p><h3>Tree-shaking</h3><p>If your library runs in a browser, and it does more than <em>one</em> thing, you'd better support <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tree shaking</a> — otherwise, every app using your library will ship useless dead code to the end users' browsers. To get started, create a modular build:</p><ul><li>Set <code>modules: false</code> in <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>@babel/preset-env</code> config</a> to preserve <code>import / export</code></li><li>Add <code>&quot;sideEffects&quot;: false</code> or <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list your side-effect modules</a> explicitly in <code>package.json</code>.</li><li>Point the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/author-libraries/#final-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-standard <code>module</code></a> field of <code>package.json</code> to the resulting entrypoint.</li></ul><p>Now a module-capable bundler can pick it up and remove unused code from the final bundle. Cool.</p><p>However, node &lt;= 12 does not support import / export syntax <em>without a flag</em>. I'm lost in all the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new <code>&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;</code> / <code>&quot;.mjs&quot;</code></a>, but shipping a <a href="https://web.dev/publish-modern-javascript/#modern-with-legacy-fallback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fallback CommonJS build</a> works fine in all node versions and older bundlers. For a library that works both client- and server-side, keep a CommonJS (<code>exports / require</code>) version (generated with a <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass of babel</a> with <code>modules: 'commonjs'</code>), referenced in <code>main</code> field of <code>package.json</code>.</p><p>There's more to tree shaking — some patterns are not tree-shakable, it affects your API choices, complex topic. We'll save for it later — supporting basic tree-shaking with ES modules is always a good start.</p><h3>Polyfills</h3><p>Should your library include the polyfills for recent browser APIs you use? It's a <a href="https://github.com/w3ctag/polyfills/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprisingly debatable issue</a> among OSS authors. Problem, short version: in most app setups, <code>babel</code> doesn't process <code>node_modules</code>, possibly breaking the final app in older browsers. <em>But</em> if you include a polyfill, removing it is from an app that only targets modern browsers is super hard. Also, the final bundle is likely to contain duplicate polyfills of one API.</p><p>I'll stick with <a href="https://github.com/w3ctag/polyfills/issues/6#issuecomment-272222513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich</a> <a href="https://github.com/w3ctag/polyfills/issues/6#issuecomment-272651240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harris</a> on this one:</p><ul><li><em>Never</em> include global polyfills that patch <code>BuiltIn.prototype</code> or <code>window</code> — they can clash with other global polyfills, and are not tree-shakable.</li><li>Use helper functions (aka <a href="https://ponyfill.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>ponyfills</em></a>) like <code>export function startsWith</code> if for code reuse.</li><li>Prefer well-supported APIs if possible — using <code>str.indexOf(...) === 0</code> instead of <code>startsWith</code> is not <em>that</em> hard.</li><li>Clearly say what targets you support in the readme. Don't pretend to support IE11 if you're not very serious. Maybe provide instructions on setting up <code>babel-loader</code> to process your library.</li></ul><h3>Bundling</h3><p>You <em>could</em> bundle your code, but I think it creates more problems than it solves at the start. How to exclude your dependencies from the bundle? What <code>libraryTarget</code> do you need? Are we sure bundling does not accidentally create non-tree-shakable logic? I'd stick with babel CLI and ship the code as separate JS files: <code>npx babel src --out-dir dist</code>.</p><h2>Typings</h2><p>TypeScript is a major player in the JS ecosystem these days. Libraries without TS types explode in TS projects with <code>Could not find a declaration file for module '...'</code>, forcing users to either <code>@ts-ignore</code> it or slap together custom ambient declarations. Some lazier developers will probably move to the next library, and I won't blame them.</p><p><img src="/images/no-dts.png" alt=""></p><p>Shipping TS types is actually easy: if you write in TypeScript, <code>tsc --declaration</code> (<code>--declarationOnly</code> if you build with babel, see <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#declaration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a>) into your build folder. If you write pure JS, it's even easier — just write a custom <code>index.d.ts</code> file describing your library, and copy it to build folder. Now point <code>types</code> field in <code>package.json</code> to the declaration entry point, and you're all set! Don't worry about <code>@types/*</code> pacakges for now. See full <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html#including-declarations-in-your-npm-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TS docs on publishing</a> if you have any trouble.</p><p>I don't know much about Flow, and no one ever asked me to support it, but if you're a fan, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61889988/exporting-my-own-flow-type-with-npm-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SO tips on doing that.</a></p><h2>Understand dependencies vs dev/peerDependencies</h2><p>In app development <code>dependencies</code> (<code>npm i</code>) vs <code>devDependenices</code> (<code>npm i --dev</code>) is not a real issue — sure, <code>dev</code> is for your build pipeline, <code>dependencies</code> for real runtime libraries, but it mostly works fine if you mess up. The difference is critical for libraries, though:</p><ul><li><code>devDependencies</code> are not installed after <code>npm i your-lib</code>.</li><li><code>dependencies</code> are automatically installed along with your package. If the user (or some other package) requests a different version of the same dependency, they may get duplicated, but at least it usually works.</li><li><code>peerDependencies</code> allow you to reference a package explicitly installed by your users. This ensures the dependency instance is shared between user code and your library, which is crucial for <em>plugins</em> — react components, express middlewares, etc. In effect, this forces a single dependency version per app — your users can't upgrade to react 18 until you support it. Assume the users have to install peers manually — sure, npm 7+ installs <a href="https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/#peer-dependencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">them automatically</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yarn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pnpm</a> don't. People hate manually installing stuff they don't care about to get the project to build, so don't overuse peers.</li><li><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#bundleddependencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bundledDependencies</a> and <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#optionaldependencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optionalDependencies?</a> You don't need them.</li></ul><p>Basic guideline: all the runtime dependencies go into <code>dependencies</code>. <em>Plugins</em> should put the main library into <code>peerDependencies</code>.</p><h2>Changelog</h2><p>I install your library, and I'm happy with it. Some time later, it's friday evening and I can't get real job done any more. I decide to update my dependencies, and discover that your library moved from <code>1.0.3</code> to <code>2.3.0</code>.</p><ul><li>Have you fixed some important bugs, so that I need to update <strong>right now</strong>?</li><li>Have you added new features I might enjoy?</li><li>What's the breaking change in v2, and how do I update?</li></ul><p>To answer these questions, I'd love to see a changelog saying what changed in every version since <code>1.0.3</code>. Both <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GH releases</a> and a <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> in the root work fine. Otherwise, I'll have to read the commit / PR list, which is likely to make me very sad.</p><hr><p>So, here's my list of stuff to keep in mind when publishing a JS library:</p><p>Must have:</p><ol><li>A readme with a problem statement, installation command, hello world example, and full API docs.</li><li>A license: full text in project root, name in the readme and in <code>package.json</code></li><li>TS typings (unless it's a CLI tool).</li><li>Changelog in GH releases or a <code>changelog.md</code>.</li></ol><p>Managing dependencies:</p><ol><li>Runtime <code>dependencies</code> go into <code>package.json</code></li><li><em>Plugins</em> make the <em>master library</em> a <code>peerDependency</code></li></ol><p>Build setup:</p><ol><li>Transpile the code to standard JS.</li><li>Running in browsers? Ship es-modules entrypoint in <code>package.json</code> <code>modules</code> for tree shaking.</li><li>Running on node? Ship CommonJS entrypoint in <code>main</code>.</li><li>Avoid global polyfills.</li><li>Don't bundle.</li></ol></div><span class="share"><div><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=&text= by @thoughtspile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweet</a></div><div id="share-button"><a>Share</a></div><div><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https://blog.thoughtspile.tech/2021/11/20/open-source-starter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discuss on Twitter</a></div></span><div class="post-related">More? <a class="tag-link-link" href="/">All articles ever</a> <a class="tag-link-link" href="/tags/open source" rel="tag">open source</a> <a class="tag-link-link" href="/tags/javascript" rel="tag">javascript</a></div><div class="post-actions">Written in <time>2021</time> by&nbsp;your friend, <a href="/">Vladimir.</a> Follow&nbsp;me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/thoughtspile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> to&nbsp;get post updates.
