Personally, I mostly work with JS — solid choice, but everyone and their dog learns JS these days, so it might be time to add some diversity. I'm curious — which <em>single</em> programming language covers the most bases for you, and gives you <em>most</em> career opportunities for years to come? That's the question we'll try to answer today.</p><p>Here's the plan. I made a list of 8 tech specializations:</p><ul><li>2 web development areas: back- and front-end. Both pretty big areas, and ones I have most experience with.</li><li>Mobile and desktop native app development. Native app development (especially desktop apps) seems to have fallen out of favor, but there's still enough work in these areas.</li><li>Quality assurance automation. QA grows along with engineering, and increasingly relies on automated tests.</li><li>Embedded systems. We'll focus on microcontroller programming, not fat boxes with a full windows / linux OS. Quite a promising area with the growth of IoT.</li><li>Game development. Granted, I don't know much about this area, but I'll do my best to cover it as well, as many developers dream of building a fun game someday.</li><li>Data analysis and Machine Learning. One of the most hyped areas of the last decade.</li></ul><p>The contenders are the usual suspects from <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TIOBE top 20</a>: python, C, C++, Java (grouped with Kotlin and other JVM languages), C# (again, throw in VB and other .NET languages), JavaScript (and TypeScript), PHP, Go, Swift, Ruby, Rust. I left out SQL and Scratch, because they're not general-purpose languages, and Fortan with Matlab, because they aren't really used outside of scientific / engineering computing.</p><p>A language scores 1 point by being the industry standard in the area — vast community and ecosystem, abundant jobs. Being useful for <em>certain</em> tasks in the area gets you 0.5 points.</p><p>So, let's see what languages will make you the most versatile engineer, shall we?</p><h2>Backend</h2><p>Let's start with the simple one — Java,	C#, Python, PHP, Go and Ruby are all excellent back-end programming languages. Of these, I'd say PHP is slightly <em>more</em> useful as many low-code solutions rely on it, and Ruby is steadily declining. Still, all these languages have earned 1 point.</p><p>Next, 0.5 points go to:</p><ul><li>C++, used in high-load and time-critical scenarios,</li><li>JS — node.js is often used to support front-end, but there aren't that many strictly back-end jobs for JS developers.</li><li>Rust — still not that widely used, but growing fast.</li></ul><p>The only languages to fail here are Swift (technically usable on server via e.g. <a href="https://vapor.codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vapor</a>, but I couldn't find any jobs in this stack) and C.</p><h2>Frontend</h2><p>Obviously, JavaScript is <em>the</em> language for front-end developers, which runs natively in browsers. But, surprise, other languages still qualify!</p><p>All solid back-end languages (Java, C#, Python, PHP, Go, Ruby) get 0.5 points, because you can solve many UI problems by rendering HTML server-side the old-school way. C# has a slight edge here, since <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blazor</a> is quite smart and popular.</p><p>C, C++, and Rust score 0.5 points because they can be compiled to WebAssembly and run in the browser — just look at <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figma.</a> Rust also powers some cool JS tooling, like <a href="https://biomejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biome</a> and <a href="https://swc.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swc</a></p><p>The only language to fail here is, again, Swift.</p><h2>QA automation</h2><p>The topic of QA automation is really simple.</p><p>Java and python get the cake — Allure, Selenium, JUnit, and pytest are the most sought-after automation tools on the market right now.</p><p>JS gets 0.5 points for playwright and cypress — the preferred tools for testing complex web front-ends. <em>A few</em> automation tools support C# — worth 0.2 points.</p><h2>Mobile apps</h2><p>Another straightforward area. Android apps are written in JVM languages (Java / Kotlin), iOS is integrated with Swift (finally).</p><p>JS scores 0.5 points, because you can effectively build apps with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native,</a> and you can get pretty far with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PWA</a> or a good old WebView.</p><p>Another 0.5 point for C#, thanks to <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xamarin</a> and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MAUI.</a></p><h2>Desktop apps (windows / linux / MacOS)</h2><p>The three kings here are C++, C#, and Java. JS gets 0.5 points, again, for <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron</a> — disgusting or not, it's widely used. Another 0.5 points for Swift, because that's what you build MacOS apps with, but MacOS computers are relatively niche.</p><p>Rust has the highly-hyped <a href="https://tauri.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tauri</a> project for building desktop apps, but it's not that widespread, and I'm not aware of any high-profile apps using it. Let's give each 0.2 points for the effort and check back later.</p><h2>Embedded systems</h2><p>Embedded systems are usually tight on resources, so compiled languages are the way to go here. Basically any embedded job requires C and C++.</p><p>Rust is, as usual, <em>very promising,</em> but not that popular yet, so 0.5 points. Another half-point for Python — used for edge computer vision and prototyping, but struggling with high memory requirements.</p><h2>Game development</h2><p>The primary languages in big gamedev are C++ (used in Unreal Engine) and C# (for Unity).</p><p>Since mobile games are a thing, Java and Swift get 0.5 points each, because that's what you'll likely use here. Another 0.5 points for JS (browser games).</p><p>Rust <em>should</em> be quite a good fit for games, but (as expected by now) it's not quite there yet.</p><h2>Data Analysis &amp; Machine Learning</h2><p>It's no secret that Python is the language of choice for anything data-related, and most of the cutting edge stuff happens, well deserved 1 point here.</p><p>But do you know there's another top language to get your piece of Data &amp; ML hype? Big companies have a lot of data, right? And big companies love Java. So, many big data tools (especially coming from Apache — Hadoop, Spark, Jena) work with Java, and most data jobs require experience with python <em>or</em> java, so another 1 point for java.</p><p>On to more surprises. Large chunks of data-heavy python libraries are actually written in C / C++ — e.g. over a third of <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numpy</a>, or most of <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LlamaCPP</a> — which earns both half-a-point. As you'd expect, Rust is also gaining traction for this use case with stuff like <a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pola.rs</a>, so another 0.2 points!</p><p>The final half-a-point goes to JS for powering much of the UI / visualization stuff (see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bokeh</a>).</p><hr><p>Before we reveal our final ranking, let's weigh the categories, because they're <em>not</em> the same size. I've used some back-of-the-napkin analysis of job postings and sizing of reddit / linkedin groups and my personal experience. With <em>backend</em> as our reference, I'd say <em>frontend</em> is roughly the same size. Mobile development is surprisingly sizable — let's give it a 0.6 weight. For QA, I'd say 0.2 makes sense, as 1 QA per 3–5 devs is a normal ratio, and manual QA is still a thing. Desktop is easily the smallest area, looks like a 0.1 to me. For gamedev, 0.5 is just my random guess. Finally, there are surprisingly many data people — with the good salaries, let's make it a 0.6.</p><p>Putting it all together:</p><p><img src="/images/top-languages.png" alt=""></p><ol><li>Java takes the first spot by a good margin by topping 5 categories, and having some gamedev / frontend capabilities. Place other JVM languages (especially Kotlin) around here, but with a discount since they're not as widely used.</li><li>The next three are really close, but JS gets <em>slighly</em> ahead by being average at everything except embedded, even though it's only the top choice for front-end development.</li><li>Python and C# tie for the third place. Both are top-tier backend languages with other strong areas (QA / ML for python, desktop and gamedev for C#).</li><li>C++ is not that far behind either, as it's still the top language when it comes to efficiency. It also steps into other languages' realms when they need some speedup (WebAssembly / ML).</li><li>Next come &quot;three backend friends&quot; — Go, PHP, and Ruby. All top-notch languages for building web backends, but not much else beyond that. Of these, Ruby is on the decline, and PHP and Go both have their separate niches.</li><li>Rust does not score that well, but still makes it into the top 10 — not bad for such a new language. It has great growth potential by eating at the traditional C++ areas, super excited to see where it gets in 3–5 years.</li><li>We all love good old C, but C++ looks like a better fit for complex systems.</li><li>Swift comes in last — fair enough for a language that's only useful for the products of one single company.</li></ol><p>Perhaps surprisingly, the <em>single most useful</em> language is Java. Python and JS, beginner favorites, come strong, with a very different focus. C# perhaps deserves a bit more attention.</p><p>Overall, today we've learnt about many amazing technologies that allow languages to sneak into each other's territory. If you were to start anew, what language would you learn?</p></div><span class="share"><div><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://thoughtspile.github.io/2024/01/09/top-languages/&text=The most useful programming language by @thoughtspile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweet</a></div><div id="share-button"><a>Share</a></div></span><div class="social-links"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vklepov/" class="link--bare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="linkedin" class="svg-inline--fa fa-linkedin fa-w-14" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M416 32H31.9C14.3 32 0 46.5 0 64.3v383.4C0 465.5 14.3 480 31.9 480H416c17.6 0 32-14.5 32-32.3V64.3c0-17.8-14.4-32.3-32-32.3zM135.4 416H69V202.2h66.5V416zm-33.2-243c-21.3 0-38.5-17.3-38.5-38.5S80.9 96 102.2 96c21.2 0 38.5 17.3 38.5 38.5 0 21.3-17.2 38.5-38.5 38.5zm282.1 243h-66.4V312c0-24.8-.5-56.7-34.5-56.7-34.6 0-39.9 27-39.9 54.9V416h-66.4V202.2h63.7v29.2h.9c8.9-16.8 30.6-34.5 62.9-34.5 67.2 0 79.7 44.3 79.7 101.9V416z"></path></svg></a><a href="https://github.com/thoughtspile" class="link--bare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="github" class="svg-inline--fa fa-github fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 496 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6 0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6 0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3 0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1 0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4 0 0-70 15-84.7-29.8 0 0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6 0 0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4 0 0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5 0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9 0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4 0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6 0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6 0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9 0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"></path></svg></a><a href="/atom.xml" class="link--bare" target="_blank"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="rss" class="svg-inline--fa fa-rss fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M0 64C0 46.3 14.3 32 32 32c229.8 0 416 186.2 416 416c0 17.7-14.3 32-32 32s-32-14.3-32-32C384 253.6 226.4 96 32 96C14.3 96 0 81.7 0 64zM128 416c0 35.3-28.7 64-64 64s-64-28.7-64-64s28.7-64 64-64s64 28.7 64 64zM32 160c159.1 0 288 128.9 288 288c0 17.7-14.3 32-32 32s-32-14.3-32-32c0-123.7-100.3-224-224-224c-17.7 0-32-14.3-32-32s14.3-32 32-32z"></path></svg></a></div><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/thoughtspile" class="link--bare bmc-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><b>Hello, friend!</b> My name is Vladimir, and I love writing about web development.
