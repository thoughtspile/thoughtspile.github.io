Personally, I mostly work with JS — solid choice, but everyone and their dog learns JS these days, so it might be time to add some diversity. I'm curious — which <em>single</em> programming language covers the most bases for you, and gives you <em>most</em> career opportunities for years to come? That's the question we'll try to answer today.</p><p>Here's the plan. I made a list of 8 tech specializations:</p><ul><li>2 web development areas: back- and front-end. Both pretty big areas, and ones I have most experience with.</li><li>Mobile and desktop native app development. Native app development (especially desktop apps) seems to have fallen out of favor, but there's still enough work in these areas.</li><li>Quality assurance automation. QA grows along with engineering, and increasingly relies on automated tests.</li><li>Embedded systems. We'll focus on microcontroller programming, not fat boxes with a full windows / linux OS. Quite a promising area with the growth of IoT.</li><li>Game development. Granted, I don't know much about this area, but I'll do my best to cover it as well, as many developers dream of building a fun game someday.</li><li>Data analysis and Machine Learning. One of the most hyped areas of the last decade.</li></ul><p>The contenders are the usual suspects from <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TIOBE top 20</a>: python, C, C++, Java (grouped with Kotlin and other JVM languages), C# (again, throw in VB and other .NET languages), JavaScript (and TypeScript), PHP, Go, Swift, Ruby, Rust. I left out SQL and Scratch, because they're not general-purpose languages, and Fortan with Matlab, because they aren't really used outside of scientific / engineering computing.</p><p>A language scores 1 point by being the industry standard in the area — vast community and ecosystem, abundant jobs. Being useful for <em>certain</em> tasks in the area gets you 0.5 points.</p><p>So, let's see what languages will make you the most versatile engineer, shall we?</p><h2>Backend</h2><p>Let's start with the simple one — Java,	C#, Python, PHP, Go and Ruby are all excellent back-end programming languages. Of these, I'd say PHP is slightly <em>more</em> useful as many low-code solutions rely on it, and Ruby is steadily declining. Still, all these languages have earned 1 point.</p><p>Next, 0.5 points go to:</p><ul><li>C++, used in high-load and time-critical scenarios,</li><li>JS — node.js is often used to support front-end, but there aren't that many strictly back-end jobs for JS developers.</li><li>Rust — still not that widely used, but growing fast.</li></ul><p>The only languages to fail here are Swift (technically usable on server via e.g. <a href="https://vapor.codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vapor</a>, but I couldn't find any jobs in this stack) and C.</p><h2>Frontend</h2><p>Obviously, JavaScript is <em>the</em> language for front-end developers, which runs natively in browsers. But, surprise, other languages still qualify!</p><p>All solid back-end languages (Java, C#, Python, PHP, Go, Ruby) get 0.5 points, because you can solve many UI problems by rendering HTML server-side the old-school way. C# has a slight edge here, since <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blazor</a> is quite smart and popular.</p><p>C, C++, and Rust score 0.5 points because they can be compiled to WebAssembly and run in the browser — just look at <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figma.</a> Rust also powers some cool JS tooling, like <a href="https://biomejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biome</a> and <a href="https://swc.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swc</a></p><p>The only language to fail here is, again, Swift.</p><h2>QA automation</h2><p>The topic of QA automation is really simple.</p><p>Java and python get the cake — Allure, Selenium, JUnit, and pytest are the most sought-after automation tools on the market right now.</p><p>JS gets 0.5 points for playwright and cypress — the preferred tools for testing complex web front-ends. <em>A few</em> automation tools support C# — worth 0.2 points.</p><h2>Mobile apps</h2><p>Another straightforward area. Android apps are written in JVM languages (Java / Kotlin), iOS is integrated with Swift (finally).</p><p>JS scores 0.5 points, because you can effectively build apps with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native,</a> and you can get pretty far with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PWA</a> or a good old WebView.</p><p>Another 0.5 point for C#, thanks to <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xamarin</a> and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MAUI.</a></p><h2>Desktop apps (windows / linux / MacOS)</h2><p>The three kings here are C++, C#, and Java. JS gets 0.5 points, again, for <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electron</a> — disgusting or not, it's widely used. Another 0.5 points for Swift, because that's what you build MacOS apps with, but MacOS computers are relatively niche.</p><p>Rust has the highly-hyped <a href="https://tauri.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tauri</a> project for building desktop apps, but it's not that widespread, and I'm not aware of any high-profile apps using it. Let's give each 0.2 points for the effort and check back later.</p><h2>Embedded systems</h2><p>Embedded systems are usually tight on resources, so compiled languages are the way to go here. Basically any embedded job requires C and C++.</p><p>Rust is, as usual, <em>very promising,</em> but not that popular yet, so 0.5 points. Another half-point for Python — used for edge computer vision and prototyping, but struggling with high memory requirements.</p><h2>Game development</h2><p>The primary languages in big gamedev are C++ (used in Unreal Engine) and C# (for Unity).</p><p>Since mobile games are a thing, Java and Swift get 0.5 points each, because that's what you'll likely use here. Another 0.5 points for JS (browser games).</p><p>Rust <em>should</em> be quite a good fit for games, but (as expected by now) it's not quite there yet.</p><h2>Data Analysis &amp; Machine Learning</h2><p>It's no secret that Python is the language of choice for anything data-related, and most of the cutting edge stuff happens, well deserved 1 point here.</p><p>But do you know there's another top language to get your piece of Data &amp; ML hype? Big companies have a lot of data, right? And big companies love Java. So, many big data tools (especially coming from Apache — Hadoop, Spark, Jena) work with Java, and most data jobs require experience with python <em>or</em> java, so another 1 point for java.</p><p>On to more surprises. Large chunks of data-heavy python libraries are actually written in C / C++ — e.g. over a third of <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numpy</a>, or most of <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LlamaCPP</a> — which earns both half-a-point. As you'd expect, Rust is also gaining traction for this use case with stuff like <a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pola.rs</a>, so another 0.2 points!</p><p>The final half-a-point goes to JS for powering much of the UI / visualization stuff (see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bokeh</a>).</p><hr><p>Before we reveal our final ranking, let's weigh the categories, because they're <em>not</em> the same size. I've used some back-of-the-napkin analysis of job postings and sizing of reddit / linkedin groups and my personal experience. With <em>backend</em> as our reference, I'd say <em>frontend</em> is roughly the same size. Mobile development is surprisingly sizable — let's give it a 0.6 weight. For QA, I'd say 0.2 makes sense, as 1 QA per 3–5 devs is a normal ratio, and manual QA is still a thing. Desktop is easily the smallest area, looks like a 0.1 to me. For gamedev, 0.5 is just my random guess. Finally, there are surprisingly many data people — with the good salaries, let's make it a 0.6.</p><p>Putting it all together:</p><p><img src="/images/top-languages.png" alt=""></p><ol><li>Java takes the first spot by a good margin by topping 5 categories, and having some gamedev / frontend capabilities. Place other JVM languages (especially Kotlin) around here, but with a discount since they're not as widely used.</li><li>The next three are really close, but JS gets <em>slighly</em> ahead by being average at everything except embedded, even though it's only the top choice for front-end development.</li><li>Python and C# tie for the third place. Both are top-tier backend languages with other strong areas (QA / ML for python, desktop and gamedev for C#).</li><li>C++ is not that far behind either, as it's still the top language when it comes to efficiency. It also steps into other languages' realms when they need some speedup (WebAssembly / ML).</li><li>Next come &quot;three backend friends&quot; — Go, PHP, and Ruby. All top-notch languages for building web backends, but not much else beyond that. Of these, Ruby is on the decline, and PHP and Go both have their separate niches.</li><li>Rust does not score that well, but still makes it into the top 10 — not bad for such a new language. It has great growth potential by eating at the traditional C++ areas, super excited to see where it gets in 3–5 years.</li><li>We all love good old C, but C++ looks like a better fit for complex systems.</li><li>Swift comes in last — fair enough for a language that's only useful for the products of one single company.</li></ol><p>Perhaps surprisingly, the <em>single most useful</em> language is Java. Python and JS, beginner favorites, come strong, with a very different focus. C# perhaps deserves a bit more attention.</p><p>Overall, today we've learnt about many amazing technologies that allow languages to sneak into each other's territory. If you were to start anew, what language would you learn?</p></div><span class="share"><div><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://thoughtspile.github.io/2024/01/09/top-languages/&text=The most useful programming language by @thoughtspile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweet</a></div><div id="share-button"><a>Share</a></div><div><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https://thoughtspile.github.io/2024/01/09/top-languages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discuss on Twitter</a></div></span><div class="social-links"><a href="https://twitter.com/thoughtspile" class="link--bare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="twitter" class="svg-inline--fa fa-twitter fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M459.37 151.716c.325 4.548.325 9.097.325 13.645 0 138.72-105.583 298.558-298.558 298.558-59.452 0-114.68-17.219-161.137-47.106 8.447.974 16.568 1.299 25.34 1.299 49.055 0 94.213-16.568 130.274-44.832-46.132-.975-84.792-31.188-98.112-72.772 6.498.974 12.995 1.624 19.818 1.624 9.421 0 18.843-1.3 27.614-3.573-48.081-9.747-84.143-51.98-84.143-102.985v-1.299c13.969 7.797 30.214 12.67 47.431 13.319-28.264-18.843-46.781-51.005-46.781-87.391 0-19.492 5.197-37.36 14.294-52.954 51.655 63.675 129.3 105.258 216.365 109.807-1.624-7.797-2.599-15.918-2.599-24.04 0-57.828 46.782-104.934 104.934-104.934 30.213 0 57.502 12.67 76.67 33.137 23.715-4.548 46.456-13.32 66.599-25.34-7.798 24.366-24.366 44.833-46.132 57.827 21.117-2.273 41.584-8.122 60.426-16.243-14.292 20.791-32.161 39.308-52.628 54.253z"></path></svg></a><a href="https://mastodon.online/@thoughtspile" class="link--bare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="mastodon" class="svg-inline--fa fa-mastodon fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M433 179.11c0-97.2-63.71-125.7-63.71-125.7-62.52-28.7-228.56-28.4-290.48 0 0 0-63.72 28.5-63.72 125.7 0 115.7-6.6 259.4 105.63 289.1 40.51 10.7 75.32 13 103.33 11.4 50.81-2.8 79.32-18.1 79.32-18.1l-1.7-36.9s-36.31 11.4-77.12 10.1c-40.41-1.4-83-4.4-89.63-54a102.54 102.54 0 0 1-.9-13.9c85.63 20.9 158.65 9.1 178.75 6.7 56.12-6.7 105-41.3 111.23-72.9 9.8-49.8 9-121.5 9-121.5zm-75.12 125.2h-46.63v-114.2c0-49.7-64-51.6-64 6.9v62.5h-46.33V197c0-58.5-64-56.6-64-6.9v114.2H90.19c0-122.1-5.2-147.9 18.41-175 25.9-28.9 79.82-30.8 103.83 6.1l11.6 19.5 11.6-19.5c24.11-37.1 78.12-34.8 103.83-6.1 23.71 27.3 18.4 53 18.4 175z"></path></svg></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vklepov/" class="link--bare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="linkedin" class="svg-inline--fa fa-linkedin fa-w-14" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M416 32H31.9C14.3 32 0 46.5 0 64.3v383.4C0 465.5 14.3 480 31.9 480H416c17.6 0 32-14.5 32-32.3V64.3c0-17.8-14.4-32.3-32-32.3zM135.4 416H69V202.2h66.5V416zm-33.2-243c-21.3 0-38.5-17.3-38.5-38.5S80.9 96 102.2 96c21.2 0 38.5 17.3 38.5 38.5 0 21.3-17.2 38.5-38.5 38.5zm282.1 243h-66.4V312c0-24.8-.5-56.7-34.5-56.7-34.6 0-39.9 27-39.9 54.9V416h-66.4V202.2h63.7v29.2h.9c8.9-16.8 30.6-34.5 62.9-34.5 67.2 0 79.7 44.3 79.7 101.9V416z"></path></svg></a><a href="/atom.xml" class="link--bare" target="_blank"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fab" data-icon="rss" class="svg-inline--fa fa-rss fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M0 64C0 46.3 14.3 32 32 32c229.8 0 416 186.2 416 416c0 17.7-14.3 32-32 32s-32-14.3-32-32C384 253.6 226.4 96 32 96C14.3 96 0 81.7 0 64zM128 416c0 35.3-28.7 64-64 64s-64-28.7-64-64s28.7-64 64-64s64 28.7 64 64zM32 160c159.1 0 288 128.9 288 288c0 17.7-14.3 32-32 32s-32-14.3-32-32c0-123.7-100.3-224-224-224c-17.7 0-32-14.3-32-32s14.3-32 32-32z"></path></svg></a></div><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/thoughtspile" class="link--bare bmc-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><b>Hello, friend!</b> My name is Vladimir, and I love writing about web development.
