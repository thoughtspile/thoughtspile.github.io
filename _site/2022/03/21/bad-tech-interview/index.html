            I’ve taken part in well over a hundred tech interviews now, on both
            sides. Some were fun, and some were pure cringe. I’ve been asked if
            I have kids (supposedly, people with children won’t have time to job
            hop), and if “I bet my ass I cost that much”. Fun times.
          </p>
          <p>
            But today I’d like to talk about cringe tech interview question
            posing as valid ones. They’re on topic, but they do nothing but
            annoy and frustrate the candidate. Some are beyond saving, while
            some are fine, but often mishandled by the interviewer. Here are the
            main offenders:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              What happens if you build a circular prototype chain? And other
              intervew trivia.
            </li>
            <li>
              How to migrate from webpack 3 to webpack 5? And other specifics.
            </li>
            <li>
              What’s the difference between a number and an array? And other
              questions obfuscated with fuzzy wording.
            </li>
            <li>
              What’s the fastest way to convert a string to number? And other
              unspecified behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
              How to make this code sample <em>better</em>? And other questions
              with missing context.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I’ll share tips both for the interviewers to spend their time
            better, and for the candidates who hit some of these. Beware, I’m
            using examples in JavaScript, but you’ll easily find parallels in
            your preferred language. Let’s go!
          </p>
          <h2 id="Trivia">
            <a href="#Trivia" class="headerlink" title="Trivia"></a>Trivia
          </h2>
          <p>
            This first category comprises questions that are popular in
            interviews, but rarely arise in practice. What happens when we run
            the following code?
          </p>
          <pre
            class="language-js"
            data-language="js"
          ><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span><span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> y <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span><span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>x<span class="token punctuation">.</span>__proto__ <span class="token operator">=</span> y<span class="token punctuation">;</span>y<span class="token punctuation">.</span>__proto__ <span class="token operator">=</span> x<span class="token punctuation">;</span>console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">.</span>field<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
          <p>
            We modify the prototype chain in runtime to make it circular. You’ve
            probably guessed the answer is “nothing good”. You’d never write
            code like this in production. What a maniac would use
            <a

              >the ad-hoc standardized and since deprecated
              <code>__proto__</code> property?</a
            >) Of course, the “correct” answer is that
            <code>y.__proto__ = x</code> throws
            <code>TypeError: Cyclic __proto__ value</code>, thanks, that’s good
            to know.
          </p>
          <p>
            These questions only show how many interviews the candidate has been
            in, and it’s in case you’ve picked a popular question. If you’ve
            just come up with a “tricky question that’s not on the web”
            yourself, it’s just a dice roll of spec momorization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Old-style JS questions are a notable sub-category of trivia. Yes,
            those of us who started programming back before 2015 know how
            <code>var</code> hoisting works, and how to declare (and even
            extend) a class with <code>.prototype</code> Here, you’re
            effectively testing when the developer started learning JS (or if
            he’s worked on a legacy codebase), which is already on the CV.
            <em>Maybe</em> worth it if you have a legacy project yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an interviewer, avoid questions that have nothing to do with the
            real-life development. The biggest fans of these questions are
            non-technical people (CEOs, founders, PMs) trying to conduct coding
            interviews by going over a question list found online. Bad news — it
            doesn’t work like that. Either hire / borrow a real developer just
            for the interviews, or stick to soft-skill topics and experience
            anecdotes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only way to answer these is, sadly, to participate in many
            interviews — or, as a cheap substitute, to browse lists of “TOP JS
            questions ever, guaranteed”. No one can realistically know every
            corner case of the language and the libraries.

            What issues does migrating to webpack 6 have? How do you check
            browser support for server-sent events? What
            <code>aria-role</code> should a modal page have? I don’t know. I
            usually google for this kind of things, and I’m pretty good at it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what happens when you take my advice on using
            <em>real-life programming</em> questions a bit too seriously, and
            drop random problems you recently solved into an interview.
            Obviously, you’ve made your research, figured out the answer, and
            are pleased with yourself. But I’m not you, we have different
            experience to complement each other — and isn’t that even better?
            Don’t label me as an <em>idiot</em> just because I’ve never touched
            a certain area of web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, ask the candidate about a challenging problem
            <em>she</em> recently solved — it’s going to be far more
            entertaining and valuable for both of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re asked this question, and have never faced the problem
            yourself, you’re in trouble. Try to access all the background
            knowledge around the topic you might have, and <em>maybe</em> you
            can even figure this out based on common sense.

            “What’s the difference between a number and an object” is the most
            surprising question ever — double the surprise every time I hear it
            yet again. Come on, what’s the difference between your head and a
            sweet potato fresh out of oven? Excuse me, am I interviewing for a
            comedian?
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem here is that a very concrete answer is expected (I
            figured out it’s “number is immutable”), but asking it directly is
            “too simple”, so you dress it up by presenting it as open-ended, and
            add some fuzziness, but in the end it just becomes impossible to
            decipher what you were trying to ask in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The worst part is that you can’t even give a hint, because the hint
            is the answer, so you’re bound to circle around confusing everyone
            further. “What can you do with numbers that you can’t with objects?”
            (Add them? Coerce to <code>false</code>?). “Think again, do numbers
            have properties?” (in
            <a

            they do). What a waste of time!
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, interview experience is key here. Once you wrap your head
            around the

            and topics, you’ll get better at recognizing them whatever costume
            they’re dressed in.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an interviewer, prefer direct questions (“Which JS types are
            immutable?”) or at least make sure your wording points in the
            intended direction, not all over the place (“What’s the difference
            between primitive types and objects?”).

            >
            log <code>x,y</code> or <code>y,x</code>? Is
            <code>x[key]</code> faster than
            <code>x.find(e =&gt; e.key === key)</code>? Under normal
            circumstances I know the answers are <code>x,y</code> (addition
            order) and <em>yes,</em> but it’s not on the spec, so I wouldn’t
            over-rely on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Performance-related questions are the most popular of this bunch. JS
            runtimes change fast, and even if you’ve seen some code perform
            better a few years ago, it might not be the case any more. The fact
            that built-in data structures in JS do not specify operation
            complexity does not help either. We reasonably
            <em>assume</em> object access <code>obj[key]</code> to take
            <em>O(1),</em> but in reality this depends on many factors — object
            size, insert / remove frequency, whether the keys are string
            literals (see
            <a
              href="https://esbench.com/bench/62385aeb6c89f600a57016a7"

              rel="noopener"
              >benchmark</a
            >). And even when the difference does exist, it’s usually abysmal
            and irrelevant to actual front-end development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, these questions are good for assessing both the practical
            knowledge of the common-case performance, the difference between
            runtimes, <em>and</em> how it applies to everyday development. As an
            interviewer, you only need two things to handle this well: be aware
            of the implementation-dependence yourself and have an open mind when
            it comes to unexpected answers. These questions are certainly
            <em>not</em> suitable for a non-interactive interview, such as a
            single-choice online survey (Pick the fastest method: a)
            <code>a.pop()</code> b) <code>a.shift()</code> c)
            <code>a.length -= 1</code>), because there’s no one right answer
            here.

            Open-ended questions are among the best you can ask in an interview
            — they’re challenging, and reveal both the candidate’s
            problem-solving skills and real-world experience. However, these
            questions are unforgiving to lazy interviewers — both sides should
            put in some effort to make them work. The two prime ways to mess
            these up are being uncollaborative and locking in to one possible
            solution.
          </p>
          <p>For example, what’s wrong with this function?</p>
          <pre
            class="language-js"
            data-language="js"
          ><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">map</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">arr<span class="token punctuation">,</span> fn</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>  <span class="token keyword">for</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">var</span> i <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> i <span class="token operator">&lt;</span> arr<span class="token punctuation">.</span>length<span class="token punctuation">;</span> i<span class="token operator">++</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">&#123;</span>    arr<span class="token punctuation">[</span>i<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">fn</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>arr<span class="token punctuation">[</span>i<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>  <span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span>  <span class="token keyword">return</span> arr<span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">&#125;</span></code></pre>
          <p>
            Why, looks perfectly fine to me. Or maybe not. Depends on what
            you’re trying to achieve. The code is rarely “right” or “wrong” by
            itself. Yes, mutating <code>arr</code> is non-idiomatic lately, but
            maybe it works in-place as an optimization. Yes, the use of
            <code>var</code> is frowned upon, but maybe it’s a library that’s
            supposed to work in IE6. Yes, we could replace the
            <code>for (;;)</code> with a <code>.map</code> or a
            <code>for..of</code>, but then we’d lose support for all
            array-likes. See, it all depends on the context. I can endlessly
            produce variations of this code, but I’d rather not if it’s not
            causing any trouble.
          </p>
          <p>
            This question is often presented as “refactor this code to make it
            BETTER” — sure to excite any junior developer. Good thing grumpy old
            Vladimir is here to tell you that “refactoring” with no clear goal
            is the greatest waste of time out there.
          </p>
          <p>
            To illustrate the solution lock-in problem, suppose you give me a
            slider gallery implemented with a horrendous mess of jQuery and ask
            to <em>improve</em> it. Problem is, you believe the best way to
            spend an hour on this is to write unit tests and convert to React. I
            think I should change jQuery to vanilla DOM and improve UX with
            better overscroll handling. Neither of us is right or wrong. In real
            life, the project goals and technical direction sets the context —
            how many jQuery dependencies we have across the codebase, if we
            intend on migrating to React, manual QA availability.
          </p>
          <p>
            When asking an open-ended question, either let go of your expected
            answer and focus on the problem-solving process, or introduce the
            missing requirements to guide towards your desired solution.

          <hr />
          <p>
            So, here are the five types of interview questions that I hate, most
            hopeless to nice-but-dangerous:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Trivia: questions that often arise in interview, but never in real
              life, e.g. “what happens if you create a circular prototype
              chain”. These test for interview experience, not development
              skills. Avoid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Specifics: solutions to unique real-life problems. Example: “how
              to migrate webpack 3 to webpack 5”. <em>Might</em> work if the
              answer can be from the expected background knowledge or if the
              area is super critical to your product. Instead, ask about a
              challenging problem the candidate recently solved.
            </li>
            <li>
              Obfuscated questions: simple questions made <em>harder</em> by
              fuzzy wording, such as “what’s the difference between a number and
              an object?” instead of “are JS numbers mutable?”. Avoid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementation questions: the answer depends on a specific JS
              runtime, e.g. “what’s the fastest way to loop over a list”. Avoid
              strong wordings and don’t bikeshed if the answer is not what you
              expected.
            </li>
            <li>
              Missing context: answer requires additional details, e.g. “how to
              improve this code”. Amazing question as long as you’re ready to
              problem-solve together, provide the missing constraints and give
              credit for noting the distinct possibilities. Worst question if
              you expect a specific question while many objectively good
              alternatives exist.

            Here’s my advice on improving interview questions, as a nice
            flowchart:

          <p>
            For candidates, I’m afraid, I have fewer actionable tips. Sure,
            practice makes perfect, and skimming the common interview questions
            won’t hurt even if you’re a hot shot lead senior, but other than
            that it’s hard to escape a bad question with an bad interviewer. You
            can’t convince the interviewer to change the question or his
            approach on the fly (if you can, apply for a top-tier sales
            representative position instead). Tough luck, but be ready to admit
            you don’t know some things, and try to work from the knowledge you
            have around the topic.

          <p>Good luck with your interviews, and see you later!</p>
